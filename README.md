# This is a Stash analyzer

The client component is a Vue.js webapp that displays your Projects, Repositories, Commits, and Dependencies (coming soon) and some useful stats and information to go along with them.

The server component is a Node app that interacts with Stash REST API via Basic Auth. OAuth would be fun though, wouldn't it?

Both are still in very early stages of development.

See each components README.md file for more information on running this thing.
